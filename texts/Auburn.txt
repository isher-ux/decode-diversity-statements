Our nation is hurting. For the last few months, we have hurt physically, financially and otherwise from the coronavirus. Now, recent events of racial injustice are hurting us in many ways that words often find inadequate to fully express.

It was on my heart to reaffirm Auburn’s values. I’m confident that we, together, will work toward change and healing.

We stand in solidarity against racism and injustice. #BlackLivesMatter #CSforALL:  As CSforALL, we acknowledge that current systems are inherently flawed, biased, and unequal. Today, in solidarity with the fight against systematic racism and white supremacy, we say this with increased emphasis. CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE INHERENTLY FLAWED, BIASED, AND UNEQUAL.

We extend our support to ALL who are actively working to identify, change, repair, and replace the systems that cultivate inequity.

Educational equity can never exist in communities where life and liberty are not fundamental rights.
